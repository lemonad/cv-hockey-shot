    This project strives to create a comprehensive teaching theory for
    shooting in the game of hockey. It divides the ice into areas players can
    and cannot score from. It explains the best areas on the net to shoot at,
    techniques and tactics that can be taught to increase scoring proficiency
    from the scoring areas. It also gives techniques and tactics for how to
    use a shot to create a scoring chance from areas of the ice where the
    initial shot is not likely to go in. Where on the goalie to shoot to
    create a quality rebound, or shoot for a deflection.

    Goaltending techniques are examined and explained. How shooters can use
    this information in order to gain an advantage when shooting a puck is
    investigated.

    The thesis is a project based thesis. The project was a drill manual.
    The manual consists of shooting drills and teaching methods for those
