I have a few different video sets I want to generate in order to be able to
test for invariance to various conditions, one of which is low light. When
I started shooting, it was not that dark and I continued shooting rounds
of pucks as the sun set.

I stopped when it got too dark to find the pucks around the canvas, not
because it was too dark to practice. Looking at the videos afterward, the
later ones were too dark to use even for manual analysis. Unfortunately enough,
it felt like it was going really well during some of those rounds.

275 recorded shots, I think.
