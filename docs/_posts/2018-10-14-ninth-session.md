A little better results this time compared to last but more interestingly, I
managed to get a complete session with the sun in the front of the canvas.
I learned that (a) the canvas is glossier than I expected so the sun causes
bright highlights on the canvas, and (b) the player can cast a shadow on the
canvas. I had imagined having to deal with shadows but not the player's own.

I also realized that the mobile I'm using for recording the canvas has dual
lenses. The 2x zoom setting makes for both less perspective distortion and much
better input data as the canvas now covers a larger part of the recorded image.
Of course, this will have to be scaled down during image analysis but having
better source data should be an advantage. The Apple models that have dual
lenses are iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone X, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Plus
so it is reasonable to use in testing (I probably should have *only* used this
setting and then applied the results on a lower resolution video to see if the
results were still applicable.)

Additionally, I introduced three targets even though I have not reached the
level of ability where it is needed (or even helpful). Spinning a positive
angle, it makes practice more challenging and fun as well as helps the puck
spread out over the whole canvas.

    Two additional targets added. The targets are fastened by tape and can be
    moved easily. The numbers are written with erasable whiteboard marker.
    Note the number of puck marks on the canvas, hopefully this does not
    interfer with image analysis. The marks do not come off easily but I am
    trying to find solutions by reading hockey forums as puck marks is a
    problem for both players and people trying to keep ice rinks clean.
