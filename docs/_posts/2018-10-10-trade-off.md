Ideally, a player has an accurate, powerful shot always available without
any time to set it up. In reality, hockey shots seems to be a trade-off
between three qualities [1]:

* Accuracy is obviously important given the relatively small goal and the
  incredibly skilled goalkeepers of today leaving only tiny gaps open at
  any given time.
* Powerful/fast shots are also important as, for example, it could make the
  puck reach a gap before the goalie has the time to move and block it.
  Secondly, a powerful shot increases the chance of the puck being left
  playable in the goal mouth area instead of being caught by the goalie.
* Quick release is perhaps most important as it means being able to shoot
  before the goalkeeper has had a chance to react and reposition.

A skilled player is one that can make the trade-off decisions in real time
during matches. In this way, measuring accuracy alone could mean inadvertently
teaching players to carefully set up weak shots. The question of how to
practice all the aspects simultaneously rather than the individual qualities
separately is one I will be returning to later.
