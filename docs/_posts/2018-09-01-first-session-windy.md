First time practicing and recording at Nyn√§s IP, a football field a short
distance from the summer house we rent. Due to lack of technique, I got tired
quickly which only makes it harder to get the pucks off the ground. Many
shots bounce on the grass or collide with other pucks and are then sent flying
into the canvas. I recorded 130 shots properly, excluding a round or two
for other documentation.

Clear weather but quite windy today. Accidentally recorded the first two
movies at 30 fps instead of 120 fps.
