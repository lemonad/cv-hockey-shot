While trying to improve my technique and changing things around, the results
suffered a lot and I decided it was pointless to record hundreds of shots not
lifting off the ground. I was spending a lot of time just driving to the
football field, setting everything up and then recording, time which would be
better spent on just learning how to shoot. Also, I felt a bit pressured
when recording, like I was wasting valuable celluloid film or something.

I set up the shooting pad in the garden instead without the canvas and just
practiced getting the puck off the pad with some speed and height. I found
tutorials on YouTube, shot a couple of hundred pucks, looked at some more
videos and tried again whenever I had some time over. Eventually I realized
that I was spending far too much time collecting pucks so I put the pad
about a meter from a metal netting, enabling me to practice much more
efficiently.

Despite shooting *a lot* of pucks during a couple of days, it did not pay
off immediately but at least I had a clearer view of what I should do and
not do. For example, when shooting the type of shots I was practicing, the
puck should rest against the base of the blade, not the tip. It was much
easier getting the pucks into the air using the tip but a lot less precise.
Also, I realized that buying the smallest shooting pad was not at all optimal
for a beginner. Players with good technique need very little movement space
to get pucks away with both speed and height. Having a short pad meant less
marginal for error, often running out of pad before getting the shot in the
air.

    My technique definitely needs more work.

sometimes.

    A round from the second session compared to a round from the third
    session for some sense of the difference. Looking at all the rounds from
    these two sessions, the difference is more subtle though.
