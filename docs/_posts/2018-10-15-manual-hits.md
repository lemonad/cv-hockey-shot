After having analyzed 1625 shots in total (*phew!*), here is a
[compiled PDF](https://www.dropbox.com/s/l0ulnlfstdv33m4/shots-20181015.pdf?dl=0)
of each round (missing the session from October 1, which I haven't had time
to analyze yet).

The long-term idea is to visualize this data in a more meaningful way for
a player (like myself) trying to learn how to shoot. One thing that is
painfully obvious after having manually positioned all these shots â€” becoming
good takes a long, *long* time!

    Manually compiled results from a good round, hinting towards me getting
    better. Except last session, with three targets, I have only been aiming
    at the middle target (number 2). Personal illustration by author,

For each shot, I record the following information:

1. **The hit position.** For shots outside the canvas, I approximate when the puck
   crosses the canvas plane and record the position at that time. Some shots
   bounce sideways off the ground or other pucks so never reach the canvas
   plane, here I do not wait until the pucks come to a standstill but record
   some (reasonable) position along the way.
2. **The hit time/frame.** On which video frame did the puck hit (or miss)?
   Initially I tried to always identify the very first frame where the puck
   touches the canvas. Lately, I err on the safe side as it can be very
   difficult to say for sure when there's wind, shadows, light reflections,
   etc. at play. Also, see below.
3. **Hit or miss.** If a large enough area of the puck is within the goal
   frame, then I record it as a hit, otherwise a miss.
4. **Good reference or not.** Is the recorded hit frame useful as
   training material for, say, a neural net? Perhaps the puck just barely
   touches the canvas so it provides a poor example, then I mark the hit
   frame as a questionable reference (so it could be used if I change
   my mind later) and mark the next frame as the proper reference. I also
   mark the preceding frames as reference "not hits".
5. **Bounced first.** If the puck seems to have bounced off the ground before
   I recorded its position, I mark it as having bounced. This because
   (a) the hit position should be taken with a grain of salt as the movement
   after bouncing can be erratic, (b) the power of the shot is often reduced
   which makes the hit a bad representative in terms of machine learning.
6. **Target.** Which target was the player trying to hit? For practical reasons,
   I just use a repeating sequence like 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3 rather than a random
   sequence. This is not optimal for actual training but makes little
   difference here, at this stage.

Over time, while analyzing the videos and seeing all the different edge cases,
I have realized that some of the recorded information is captured for multiple
purposes, not necessarily sharing the same goals. That is, the material
needed for training could be slightly different from the material needed for
validation and testing.

Also, it is so easy to lose track of the end goal and make suboptimal choices:
identifying the hit frames is just a proxy for determining the hit positions!
Sure, here we might need references for when a puck hits to test against but
in the long run, the only thing that matters is being able to accurately find
hit positions.

It is likely that I need to go over the material again and
reclassify as the assumptions I started with could be proven incorrect during
the course of the project. The most fundamental such assumption is that all
hits are to be included where I am more and more leaning towards that there
must be a cutoff. If it comes down to a choice between accurately positioning
all proper shots with risk of misclassifying all poor shots and, say, rough
positioning of all shots including the poorest, then I think the prior makes
the most sense.
