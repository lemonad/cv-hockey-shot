* CCM RBZ SpeedBurner stick,
* 50 pucks (supposedly smear-free but [not really]({% post_url 2018-10-14-ninth-session %})),
* Ice-like shooting pad (122x61 cm, too small in retrospect),
* Canvas (special design by [Johnny Nilsson](https://www.gih.se/Personal/Johnny-Nilsson/)),
* Slack line kit for upper suspension. *20181001* I added 1500x16mm round PVC
  conduit for stability.
* Flag line, tent pegs and 1600x20mm round PVC conduit for lower suspension.
* *20180913* A board to put the pucks on so they do not take up space on
  the shooting pad.
* Tripod with [new Glif mount](https://www.studioneat.com/products/glif) used
  with iPhone X (*20181001*), recording the shots at 120 fps at 1080p.
  Previously used an iPhone 7 Plus. *20181014* Changed to using the 2x optical
  lens.
* Tripod with [original Glif mount](https://www.studioneat.com/products/glif-originals)
  used with iPhone 6S Plus, recording the player at 60 fps at 1080p. Originally
  recorded at 30 fps (TODO check when changed this).
* Plastic bucket (for collecting pucks after two rounds @ 25 pucks).
