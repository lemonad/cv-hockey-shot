Better results overall even though the pucks are all over the canvas rather
than the one target point I'm using. I plan to switch to two targets eventually
but it would not be meaningful at this point, especially since I then would
have to keep track of which is the current target when analyzing the videos.

200 recorded shots. Sunshine and quite calm.

    The recording setup. An iPhone 6S plus for shots and an iPhone 7 Plus
    for recording the player (me). Personal photo by author. September 2018.
    <em>Update 2018-10-01:</em> I'm now using the iPhone 6S Plus to record
    myself and an iPhone X to record the shots.
