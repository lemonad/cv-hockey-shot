Second time practicing and recording at Nyn√§s IP. I lock focus and exposure
so the mobile camera does not refocus in the middle of a shot but
unfortunately, I managed to lock it so all the videos but one from today are
out of focus. On the upside, they make an interesting test set.

    Did not notice that I had locked the focus on something else than the
    canvas so all videos turned out blurry. Note that the goal net is visible
    through the canvas. Personal photo by author. September 2018.

Sunshine and calm. I recorded 194 shots.
